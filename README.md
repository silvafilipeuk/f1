##Formula 1 Data

I will be analysing the historical Formula 1 data to retrieve some usefull content as part of my data analysis learning.

I will be using Microsoft Excel to clean the data, SQL Server and Python with Pandas do analyse it, and Microsoft Power BI to produce some Dashboards.

#About Dataset

The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.
